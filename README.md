# Facial Expression Recognition System

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of a facial emotion recognition system, designed to classify emotions from portrait images.

## Overview

Facial expression recognition is a crucial aspect of human-computer interaction, with applications in various fields like psychology, marketing, robotics, and virtual assistants. This project explores the performance of traditional machine learning models for classifying five basic emotions: anger, sadness, fear, happiness, and neutral.

## Key Features

-   **Traditional ML Models:** The project implements Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Tree with Gini Index.
-   **Feature Extraction:** Utilizes Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) for extracting facial features.
-   **Datasets:** Employs AffectNet and Flickr Faces HQ datasets for training and evaluation.
-   **Performance Evaluation:** Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for each emotion class.
